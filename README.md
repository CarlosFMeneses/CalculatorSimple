`CalculatorSimple.java`: Creates a basic calculator using the Java GUI component GridLayout. App performs basic four function (add, subtract, muultiply, and divide) on two integers and display the result. GUI bases on the keyboard layout of the Busicom LE-120A "HANDY-LE", except "=" has been ommited, since this app only excepts 2 integers.
